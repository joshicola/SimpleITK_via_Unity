# SimpleITK_via_Unity

This Unity project is to demonstrate how to use the C# Simple ITK wrapper to read Nifti files.

SimpleITK is a powerful library written in C++ that allows the reading, registration, and segmentation for medical images (http://www.simpleitk.org/)

It is recommended that you download the simpleitk source and compile it with the same version of .NET as Unity was compiled with.
(https://sourceforge.net/projects/simpleitk/files/SimpleITK/0.10.0/Source/).  It is possible that there is one to download out there, but why take chances?

All Dlls and .so files from the simpleITK compiliation need to be in the Assets directory.
